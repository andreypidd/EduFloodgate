# EduFloodgate

A [Floodgate](https://github.com/GeyserMC/Floodgate) fork that adds **Minecraft Education Edition** player support for online mode Java servers. Companion plugin for [EduGeyser](https://github.com/SendableMetatype/EduGeyser).

## Features

- **Education player identity** - Deterministic UUID generation for edu players who lack Xbox Live accounts
- **Tenant-aware usernames** - Usernames formatted as prefix + name + 4-char tenant hash (e.g. `#john7a3f`) to distinguish players across schools
- **FloodgatePlayer API** - `isEducationPlayer()`, `getTenantId()`, and `getAdRole()` for downstream plugins
- **Xbox Live linking bypass** - Education clients are automatically excluded from player linking (no Xbox account to link)
- **BedrockData protocol extension** - Education fields (isEdu, tenantId, adRole) passed through the Floodgate data pipeline

## Downloads

Pre-built jars are available on the [Releases](https://github.com/SendableMetatype/EduFloodgate/releases) page.
